Project Overview:

The goal of the “LEGO Dataset Project is to load and analyze data in MySQL” from various CSV files into a MySQL database and perform advanced analyses to extract useful information about LEGO sets, colors, and more. 
By taking advantage of Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and SQL, this project provides an opportunity to practice database manipulation and data visualization.

Database Schema:
The lego_inventory database is designed to store and organize data related to LEGO sets, parts, colors, themes, and more. It includes the following tables:

Sets: Information about individual LEGO sets.
Parts: Details on specific LEGO parts.
Colors: Data related to different LEGO colors.
Themes: Information about thematic categories for LEGO sets.
Inventory: A table that links sets, parts, and colors.

Requirements To work on this project:

Python 3.x
pandas
SQLAlchemy
pymysql
matplotlib
seaborn
MySQL (for the database)
Data Loading The data is loaded from CSV files into the MySQL database using a loading script (usually named data_loading.ipynb).

Learning Goals: 

Establish and apply conditions within SQL queries.
Demonstrate the ability to filter tables effectively.
Use SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables.
Use advanced SQL queries to perform more complex data manipulations and analysis.


Prerequisites:

Fundamental concepts of database design, including entities, attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys.
Basic comprehension of SQL syntax and statements, such as CREATE, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, and DELETE.
Familiarity with the concept of NOT NULL constraints and data types in SQL.


Introduction:

The word “LEGO” comes from the Danish phrase “leg godt,” which means “play well.” It’s a fitting name for a toy that has captured the imaginations of millions worldwide.
The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, initially creating wooden toys. However, it wasn’t until 1958 that the iconic LEGO bricks we know today were introduced.
From simple building blocks to intricate sets, LEGO has become synonymous with creativity, innovation, and fun. It’s not just a toy; it’s a tool for imagination and problem-solving.
Retailers worldwide sell a staggering 7 LEGO sets every single second. 

The following notebooks provide a comprehensive analysis of the LEGO dataset. From pieces by color to themes and rarity, advanced SQL queries and Python code allow us to extract valuable insights from the data. Understanding the evolution of LEGO sets over the years becomes possible through this exploration.
