Introduction:

The word “LEGO” comes from the Danish phrase “leg godt,” which means “play well.” It’s a fitting name for a toy that has captured the imaginations of millions worldwide.
The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, initially creating wooden toys. However, it wasn’t until 1958 that the iconic LEGO bricks we know today were introduced.
From simple building blocks to intricate sets, LEGO has become synonymous with creativity, innovation, and fun. It’s not just a toy; it’s a tool for imagination and problem-solving.
Retailers worldwide sell a staggering 7 LEGO sets every single second.
